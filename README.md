# William's LaTeX-based resume

To compile the .tex file into a .pdf, you would either use an online LaTeX IDE, or you would try to compile it on your local machine.

Previously, I've did so on my local machine, so I had these tools installed:
- VSCode
- TeXLive
- TeXLive manager
- LaTeX Workshop extension for VSCode.

Then simply open the .tex file with VSCode, navigate over to the extension, and build the project (with latexmk).
If this doesn't work, make sure you open TeXLive manager to see if you have the appropriate package installed.
